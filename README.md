# About Me

----------------------------------

My name is Eric Hanks. I was born in Jefferson City, Missouri. I have lived in the area for the entirety of my life. As a direct result of living through two economic recessions, I have not traveled much, but I would like to.  

In 2021, my senior year of highschool, I enlisted in the Missouri National Guard. I did so for a variety of reasons:
- To be able to graduate college debt-free
- To be afforded the oppurtunity to volunteer for disaster relief, should the need arise
- To be able to live out my dream of building a home 

I am a Private First Class. While I was at AIT (Advance Individual Training), I learned a lot about system administration. I learned about OSPF, mediums used to transfer data, and became extremely familiar with the Cisco IOS CLI. Though I am not certain of what I want to do career-wise, I feel as if I would enjoy being a [*System Administrator*](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/network-and-computer-systems-administrators.htm "Bureau of Labor Statistics")
